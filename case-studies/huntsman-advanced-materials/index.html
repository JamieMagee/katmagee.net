                <p>Huntsman Advanced Materials, a division of the Huntsman Corporation, is a leading provider of advanced epoxy, acrylic, and polyurethane-based polymer products. Huntsman Advanced Materials enjoys a strong market position; however, the company knew that inbound marketing could open the door to drive leadsâ€”in both quantity and quality. Huntsman Advanced Materials turned to my agency, Cross-Border Communications, for its expertise in international B2B marketing.</p>
<p><img src="/img/huntsman-lead-gen-webinar.jpg" alt="The webinar demonstrated key cost reduction and process improvement opportunities, supported by technical data."></p>
<p>Huntsman Advanced Materials knew that &lsquo;cost-out&rsquo; initiatives had been a major challenge for their aerospace customers for years. Then during the pandemic, many production lines were partially or completely halted. When it came time to ramp up production again, manufacturers would need to do even more with less.</p>
<p><img src="/img/huntsman-lead-gen-e-book.jpg" alt="Based on the webinar content, the downloadable guide provided another engagement opportunity."></p>
<p>This insight drove our customer-centric, value-driven lead-generation campaign. Aimed at aerospace engineers and supply chain teams, I wrote the content for a webinar, e-book guide, and social media posts focused on reducing costs and increasing productivity. I worked closely with subject matter experts, designers, and digital marketers to make sure the campaign was spot-on in terms of content, design, and delivery for our audience and their buying journey.</p>
<p><img src="/img/huntsman-lead-gen-social-posts.jpg" alt="Social media posts highlighted key value drivers from the webinar."></p>
<p>The campaign generated over 270 webinar registrations, with 130 key industry members attending. The feedback from the webinar has been extremely positive, with many attendees stating they would be sure to sign up for all future activities.</p>
<p>This was just one of many projects for the Huntsman Corporation. Together with my agency colleagues, I helped multiple business units with everything from press releases and thought-leadership content to product catalogs and flyers.</p>
<p>(The images in this case study were made by my talented colleagues. Thank you!)</p>
