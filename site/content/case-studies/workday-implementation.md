  system.

I developed the in-system copy and training materials for our new company-wide Enterprise Resource Management system, Workday.

The challenge was to make the existing Workday UX copy and training materials easier to understand and more user-friendly, and introduce the Designit brand voice to enhance the employee experience. However, I could see that Designit’s typically playful tone would be inappropriate for what’s often a frustrating or stressful experience for employees, and would contrast starkly with the system’s hard-coded copy.

I set the direction to find a middle ground, using Designit’s voice in a more serious tone – but more ‘human’ than Workday’s. I found more room for fun and humour in the training materials and manuals we made for advanced users, such as our internal operations team.

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with service and UX designers, technologists and HR specialists to write, test, and implement multiple parts of the system at the same time to a tight overall deadline.  With a mind for strategy and a keen eye for detail, I was responsible for overall structures down to the microcopy.
