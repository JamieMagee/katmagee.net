Designit, a global strategic design agency, was preparing to implement a new Enterprise Resource Management system, Workday. With more than 500 employees spread across 12 offices, it was crucial that all Designit's employees adopted and used the new system. 

My challenge was to not only make the existing Workday UX copy easier to understand and more user-friendly. I also needed to introduce the Designit brand voice to support a consistent employee experience across all touchpoints. 

I could see that Designit’s typically playful tone would be inappropriate for what’s often a frustrating or stressful experience for employees, and would contrast starkly with the system’s hard-coded copy. 

I helped forge a middle ground, using Designit’s voice in a more serious tone – but more "human" than the default copy. I made sure that all of Designit's internal terminology was aligned (for example, using "People Team" not "HR Department") found a voice that was conversational but clear. Brief but not brusque. And empathetic to what the user might be feeling.

I was also responsible for training materials.... \
I found more room for fun and humor in the training materials and manuals we made for advanced users, such as our internal operations team. Gameification... 

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with service and UX designers, technologists, and HR specialists to write, test, and implement multiple parts of the system at the same time to a tight overall deadline.  With a mind for strategy and a keen eye for detail, I was responsible for overall structures down to the microcopy.
