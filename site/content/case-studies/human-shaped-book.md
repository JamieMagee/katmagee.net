Designit is a global strategic design agency. In 2015, Designit had doubled its headcount in just one year, expanded into new regions, and was acquired by multinational IT company Wipro.

To ensure a successful acquisition and support further growth, Designit needed to consolidate its unique culture and communicate its vision and values internally and externally.

I collected and consolidated input from key internal stakeholders from Designit's twelve offices around the globe. I then worked closely with a core steering group to define Designit's vision for a "human-shaped world" and the shared values needed to achieve this.

It was also my responsibility to set the right tone for the book. A traditional corporate vision/mission statement just would not fit with Designit's culture. We needed to explain bold dreams and big ideas in an authentic and relatable way. So we cut the cliches and corporate jargon to get straight to the point. And we channeled our rebellious streak to light a fire in people's bellies â€“ while still having some fun along the way.

From stakeholder interviews to print deadline, we had just three weeks! So with the concept and tone in place, I worked closely with a fellow copywriter and a graphic designer to get the final copy into layout, brought to life by a visual language that's bold, dynamic, and human.

The "Human-shaped world" book played an integral role at Designit's annual company event. Soon after, the vision and values were integrated all across the company, from hiring and performance review benchmarks to out-of-the-ordinary office decoration. 

With its vision and values as a foundation, Designit has successfully doubled its headcount (again), acquired companies of its own, and continued to grow its global business into new regions.
