Designit is a global strategic design agency. In 2015, Designit had doubled its headcount in just one year, expanded into new regions, and was acquired by Indian multinational IT company Wipro.

To ensure a successful acquisition and support further growth, Designit needed to consolidate its unique culture and communicate its vision and values internally and externally. However, a traditional corporate vision/mission statement just would not fit with Designit's culture.

I collected and consolidated input from key internal stakeholders from Designit's twelve offices around the globe. I then worked closely with a core steering group, including the founder and CEO, to define Designit's vision for a human-shaped world, and the shared values needed to achieve this.

It was also my responsibility to set the right tone for the book. We needed to inspire employees and clients â€“ not with talk of hopes and dreams, but by lighting a fire under their asses. We cut the cliches and corporate jargon and got to the point (while having some fun along the way). 

From there, I worked closely with a fellow copywriter and a designer to get the book ready in time for Designit's annual company event. (Three weeks!)

The book played an integral role at Designit's annual company event. But the values live and breathe beyond the printed page. The ten rules of thumb have been integrated all across the company, from hiring and performance review benchmarks to badass office decoration. Now employees can confidently say what Designit stands for. And the company has continued to successfully expand its business around the globe.
