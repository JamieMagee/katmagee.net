Designit, a global strategic design firm, had doubled its headcount in the last year, and had been acquired by a much larger multinational IT company. Designit needed to consolidate its culture, and communicate its vision and values internally and externally – without the usual bland corporate vision/mission statement.

I set the direction for the tone of the book. We wanted to inspire our employees and clients – not with talk of hopes and dreams, but by lighting a fire under their ass. We cut the BS and corporate jargon and got to the point, while having some fun along the way.

I worked with key internal stakeholders from our twelve offices around the globe to collect and consolidate their input, then with a fellow copywriter and art director to bring the book to life. From putting pen to paper to final layout, we went to print in just three weeks, in time for the company's cross-office inspiration trip.

Now employees can confidently say what we stand for, and explain it to our clients. HR uses the ten rules of thumb for hiring and performance review benchmarks. We did an initial print run of 500 copies, and have reprinted twice since.
