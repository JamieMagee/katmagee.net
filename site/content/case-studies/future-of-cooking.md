Designit is a global strategic design agency. One of its product design teams in Copenhagen wanted to target a potential client with an industry white paper incorporating macro trends and experimental ideas.

I helped research ten key global trends and how they would affect the food industry with a combination of interviews and desk research. From there, we brainstormed potential challenges, opportunities, and solutions with a series of "how might we" questions.

Unlike washing up, white papers don't have to be boring. We wanted this one to be inspirational (of course), but also fun to read. We let our imaginations run wild as we explored future concepts â€“ but made sure to keep the copy down-to-earth with a sense of humor.

After a successful client meeting in Copenhagen, we printed 100 copies to share with our sales teams around the globe. The white paper helped them spark conversations with new and existing clients to drive sales.

I also helped the global marketing team adapt this valuable thought leadership content into a series of [blogs](https://medium.designit.com/the-future-of-cooking-part-1-change-drivers-389a75bc4747) and [social media posts](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bul2Iwcg1U2/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to further engage Designit's audience online.
