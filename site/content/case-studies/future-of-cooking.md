I helped the product design team research ten key global trends, and how they would affect the food industry. From there we brainstormed potential challenges and opportunities for the industry with a series of 'how might we questions', together with potential product solutions that holistically integrated technology and service ideas.

I set the direction for the tone of the book. White papers don't have to be boring. They should be inspirational – and actually enjoyable to read. We let our imaginations run wild, while explaining bold future concepts in simple, down to earth terms with a dry sense of humour.

We [published the book online](https://issuu.com/designit/docs/future_of_cooking) to spark a conversation on social media, and drive hundreds of views to our website. We printed over a hundred copies for existing and potential clients around the globe – and one for our photographer to do some origami with.
