The Mallows is an indie confectionery brand for organic, hand-made marshmallows. Special edition seasonal marshmallows needed copy for packaging. Total of three seasons and six products to date. Provided copywriting and proofreading to very short time frame, spotting the smallest of errors or inconsistencies. 

No tone of voice guidelines, but reading website and other products, it was clear that the copy needed to be funny, playful, and even a little unexpected. 

Came up with concepts that could distinguish similar flavours or provide designer with visuals (bluckcurrant versus raspberry and egg and bunny concepts).
