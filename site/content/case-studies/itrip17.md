  Identity concept, branding and communications for Designit’s yearly
  inspiration trip. The itrip is all about getting the people of Designit in one
  place for inspiration and togetherness. I worked closely together with an art
  director to create a unique identity for 2017's itrip, that celebrated who we
  are, and what we do together.

The challenge was to create an identity for 2017's itrip that was fresh and unique, while still staying true to Designit's brand. The itrip is all about getting the people of Designit in one place for inspiration and togetherness. I worked closely with an art director to create a verbal and visual identity that celebrated who we are, and what we do together.

‘We are here’ is a bold, simple, confident statement about who we are, and what we do together. It's not a call to action – it's a promise. This simple framework unites (500 very different!) participants and lots of different applications – from comms, to merch to presentations. 

 
This identity and purpose is made up of lots of different parts. ‘We are here’ is a framework that brings together the aspect of togetherness and bold confident statements that borders on a call to action. 


‘We are here’ really shines in its application. In its simplicity, it can be applied and activated in so many messages and situations. A main feature of the identity are bold ‘we are here to ….’ statements, they are statements you can relate to and get behind. This means there is no fluff, and no bullshit.
