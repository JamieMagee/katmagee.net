Industry events are key to nurturing long-term relationships between airports and airline route planners. But how could Copenhagen Airport further these relationships between events? Copenhagen Connections was designed to keep route planners engaged with a bi-monthly newsletter, landing page, and LinkedIn posts.

I used expert interviews and my own research to write articles and LinkedIn posts, tailored to this audience with local insights, analysis, and data. I also edited articles written by industry experts to keep all content concise and consistent in house style and British English.
