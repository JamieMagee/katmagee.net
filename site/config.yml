    text: >-
      I write engaging, meaningful and effective copy. And it all starts with
      what the reader needs to know – not what the writer wants to say. 


      After graduating from Girton College, Cambridge, I moved to Copenhagen to
      pursue my career in copywriting. With experience ranging from a small
      startup company, to large international agency setting, I currently work
      as a copywriter at Designit, one of the world’s leading strategic design
      firms.
