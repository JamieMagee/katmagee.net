      Originally from the UK, I studied ancient languages and linguistics at the University of Cambridge. After graduating, I moved to Copenhagen, Denmark, where I spent seven years helping international companies ace their brand, marketing, and communications.


      I've brought my hustle to a start-up. Helped an international design firm find the story, values, and voice behind its brand. Guided new users through onboardings. Interviewed thought leaders on everything from self-driving cars to recombinant insulin. And given countless PDFs a final (final!) proofread.


      I've found that one of my biggest strengths lies in not only being quick to understand my client's business â€“ I'm also able to understand and empathize with their audience. With this perspective, I help my clients explain complex ideas in simple, engaging, and compelling ways.


      For my next adventure? Now I'm in Seattle, WA, and excited to bring these skills to the thriving technology scene here. I can help you with:


      * Research and insights

      * Concept development

      * Brand voice and tone

      * Sales and marketing content

      * Web and social copy

      * Internal communications

      * UX writing
